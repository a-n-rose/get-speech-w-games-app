# get-speech-w-games-app
Through games and story telling, collect users' speech as they play on a mobile app. Here I will brainstorm and play around with what kind of apps I can create to collect more speech data.


### Ideas:
* What your speech sounds like as the opposite gender, as an adult/child
* Who can tell a better story from something like "Rory's game cubes"? 
* Add animation to a story generated by someone? (need speech2txt for that)
* Record notes for the day as well as reminders
* Record special messages for your future self
* Have a conversation with a 3D character... challenge! Blender and so much more!!
