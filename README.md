# get-speech-w-games-app
Through games and story telling, collect users' speech as they play on a mobile app. Here I will brainstorm and play around with what kind of apps I can create to collect more speech data.


### Current "game" in development
* imitation app: earn points by mimicking another sound as closely as possible
* learn how to:
* collect, analyze, and maybe even manipulate speech with Python 
* rate performance across different types of speakers while measuring for bias 
* deal with speech data for something fun
* develop a game... and maybe even do some simple 3D animations with Blender.. we'll see..

#### Dependencies
* cffi  (cffi-1.11.5 pycparser-2.18)
* sounddevice (sounddevice-0.3.11)
* Numpy


### Ideas:
* What your speech sounds like as the opposite gender, as an adult/child
* Who can tell a better story from something like "Rory's game cubes"? 
* Add animation to a story generated by someone? (need speech2txt for that)
* Record notes for the day as well as reminders
* Record special messages for your future self
* Have a conversation with a 3D character... challenge! Blender and so much more!!
