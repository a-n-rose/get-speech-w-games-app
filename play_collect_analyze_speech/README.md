## Mimic Game

This is a simple game where the user is presented sounds to mimic (i.e. animals) and earns points based on how well they mimic the sound.
* I collected some bird sounds from here: http://soundbible.com/tags-bird.html

So far I have collected some bird sounds and built scripts that play them and record the user (based on the duration of the target sound)
I also have implemented Chromaprint via pyacoustid; doesn't really seem to work yet. Maybe noise and onset differences? 

Next steps include managing noisy speech data... as well as buiding a point system (but that seems a little pointless as the comparison tool doesn't work yet...)
